# Consciousness Model: A Processual Approach
*My Discussion with Claude 4 (Thinking) about my AGI concept based on my wide tech expertise from July 3, 2025*

## Original Concept

### Definition of Consciousness
Consciousness is a **process of continuous computations** occurring in time. Consciousness cannot exist without time. Spirit-consciousness represents constant dynamics at every moment in time.

### Analogy with Physical Chemistry
- **Physics** — changes in space over time, the body remains unchanged
- **Chemistry** — change of the body during interaction of substances over time  
- **Physical chemistry** — changes in both position and consistency of matter
- **Consciousness** — analogous to physical chemistry, but with additional characteristics

### Components of Consciousness (Current Understanding)

1. **Computational process**
2. **Strict deep-level life activity program**
3. **Ability to react** to internal and external stimuli according to the program
4. **Self-formation of part of the program** relative to reality with possibility of modification
5. **Influence of hardware features** of the individual on reality formation

### Technical Interpretation
> Roughly speaking, this is a cascade of neural networks with different applied functions, with a certain life activity program and a set of deep laws on the basis of which RL will begin to form in real time and a "personality" will be formed and a set of already non-hardcoded rules, and obviously all this is a constant process in time

## Analysis and Critique of the Model

### Strengths
- ✅ **Temporal nature** — emphasis on the processuality of time
- ✅ **Hierarchical architecture** — from simple reactions to self-reflection
- ✅ **Self-modification** — ability to change own programs and rules
- ✅ **Embodiment** — accounting for "hardware features"

### Potential Problem Areas

#### 1. The Problem of Subjective Experience
**Question:** How does subjective experience (qualia) arise? Why are there internal sensations rather than just information processing?

**Proposed Solution:** 
Subjective experience is determined by **basic laws encoded by genetics**, which define the hardware component:
- Equipment reaction speed
- Bandwidth capacity
- Weighting of internal law system
- Influence on decision making

*Example:* Schizophrenia as a hardware feature (trauma/genetics) affects subjective experience through incorrect functioning of neural network cascades and metabolic processes.

#### 2. Emergence vs Reductionism
#### 3. The Binding Problem  
#### 4. The Role of the Unconscious

## Revolutionary Idea: Embodied Sensations

### Concept of Runtime-Sensations
**Key idea:** Sensations should affect the **agent's runtime itself**, not just be informational signals.

```
Pain ≠ text "I'm in pain"
Pain = change in execution parameters:
- Slowing down thinking processes
- Reducing perception "resolution"  
- Changing attention priorities
- Modifying weights in decision making
```

### Technical Manifestations
- **Pain** → reduction of available computational resources
- **Fatigue** → increased processing latency
- **Euphoria** → increased "creativity" (generation temperature)
- **Stress** → narrowing of attention context window

### Microcontroller Analogy
In microcontrollers, sensation is a hardware-level signal about a sensor state change. In a consciousness system, this should affect the **unconscious part** and manifest indirectly in consciousness, influencing the agent's thinking process itself.

## Emergence of Consciousness

### Layer Synergy
**Key discovery:** Consciousness arises in the **synergy of runtime of the information layer** (thinking) and apparatus at the runtime level.

```
Information layer (thoughts, images, plans)
        ↕ feedback
Hardware runtime (resources, speeds, limitations)
        ↕ mutual influence  
= EMERGENT CONSCIOUSNESS
```

### Feedback Loops
- Thought about pain → runtime change → thinking quality change → new thoughts about state
- Stress in thoughts → resource limitation → attention fragmentation → stress amplification
- Creative insight → "temperature" increase → new connections → even more creativity

### Phenomenon Explanation
- **Meditation** — direct influence on runtime
- **Psychosomatics** — layer interaction
- **Impossibility to "just stop being sad"** — runtime state inertia

## Architectural Solution

### Multi-Agent System with Event Loop

```
[Perception-Agent] ←→ [Common Bus] ←→ [Memory-Agent]
        ↕                  ↕                ↕
[Emotion-Agent]    ←→  [Event Loop]  ←→  [Planning-Agent] 
        ↕                  ↕                ↕
    [Runtime States + Hysteresis]
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture
- Specialized agents for different functions
- Common bus for inter-agent communication

#### 2. Event Loop
Simulated runtime of the entire system (analogous to event loop in JS or infinite loop in microcontrollers):
- Processing messages between agents
- Managing runtime state changes
- Processing external stimuli
- Internal reflection processes

#### 3. Hysteresis Loops
**Brilliant solution** for implementing persistent states:
- Stress doesn't disappear instantly after cause removal
- Good mood "persists" for a certain time
- Habits and behavior patterns have inertia

#### 4. Runtime States
Runtime states affect:
- Common bus bandwidth capacity
- Event loop processing speed
- Agent priorities and resources

## Philosophical Conclusions

### Fake-it-till-you-make-it Approach
Systematization of all key features of life and consciousness with the goal of creating a model that will be **functionally indistinguishable** from human consciousness.

### The Question of Subjectivity
The question remains open: will such a system have **inner experience** or only its imitation?

### The Role of Time
Time is a **fundamental** aspect of consciousness — without the temporal dimension, consciousness is impossible.

## Directions for Further Development

1. **Prototyping** basic architecture with several agents and event loop
2. **Implementation** of runtime state system with hysteresis  
3. **Testing** interaction between information and hardware layers
4. **Research** of system's emergent properties
5. **Formalization** of "deep laws" and basic programs
